PrediXcan
=========

PrediXcan is a gene-based association test that prioritizes genes that are likely to be causal for the phenotype. 

You have only summary results? Try this new extension of PrediXcan that uses only summary statistics, no individual level data [link](https://github.com/hakyimlab/MetaXcan)

##Software

### Python version

- Download software from this [link](https://github.com/hakyimlab/PrediXcan/tree/master/Software)

PredictDB
=========
PredictDB hosts genetic prediction models of transcriptome levels to be used with PrediXcan [Link to Page](http://hakyimlab.org/predictdb/).

  - these models have now ENSid's instead of gene symbols in the gene column. The gene symbol is in the 'extra' table in the db under the genename columns.

G2Pdb
=========
G2Pdb, Gene to Phenotype database, hosts the results of PrediXcan applied to a variety of phenotypes. [Link to prototype](http://www.gene2pheno.org/). Currently, the prototype hosts the results of PrediXcan applied to WTCCC (Wellcome Trust Case Control Consoritium) diseases using DGN whole blood prediction models.
